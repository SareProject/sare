# SARE Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in SARE, please follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Email**: Send a detailed report to **[zolagonano@protonmail.com](mailto:zolagonano@protonmail.com)**.  
    Optionally, you can encrypt your report using our PGP key: `F22EB734505C76E59AFC95C4B4A4AEFDAFF48132`.
    
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: You can also use SARE's security advisory reporting tool provided by GitHub to report security issues: [https://github.com/SareProject/sare/security/advisories](https://github.com/SareProject/sare/security/advisories)
    

Please do **not** disclose security vulnerabilities publicly or in GitHub issues until a fix has been released. Responsible disclosure helps protect all users.
